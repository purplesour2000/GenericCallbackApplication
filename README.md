# GenericCallbackApplication
The generic callback dll must be registered on the local machine, using regasm.exe for 32 bit framework (is a 32-bit build).  

This is a simple example app/dll that displays how to take a c++ application, call a c# dll, and return events/handle callbacks from the 
c# dll.
